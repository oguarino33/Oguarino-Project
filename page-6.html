         <p>
        This site is for anyone who loves to discover new food and for everyone who doesn’t.

        I love to discover and try new food, but I haven’t always. In fact, for most of my early 
        adult life, dinner usually meant microwaving a frozen dinner or adding boiling water to something 
        that came from a box. It wasn’t until I started eating real food while going out with friends and 
        on road trips that I began to discover my passion. I started being the one to find the places to 
        eat and realized that I could really help people. Eating real food was really fun. And gaining 
        confidence as the food finder and business owner? That was life changing!
        
         </p>
         <p>
        We can sometimes get lost in the structure and routine of everyday life. 
        Finding new places to eat and expanding my palet has given me a pathway to
        discovering not only new foods but different cultures as well. With these 
        different foods comes different tradidions, spices, preparation, social 
        dynamics. Our company takes our expertise and the headache out of choosing 
        a place to eat or where to have date night. We find the best spots in town
        and share them with everyone! Of course this would not be possible without
        our amazing Team, Amy and Jenna.

         <p style="text-align: left;">
        Amy Canto is the founder of Healthy Food. She began her career in a local
        bakery where she found her passion for making food and discovering new recipes.
        She would travel around looking for recipe inspiration and find many amazing 
        small businesses around town. After spending years going around to all these 
        restaurants, she became friends with co-founder, Jenna Ward, and realized they 
        could use this knowledge and share it with the world. Today, she resides in Southern
        California and enjoys hearing the stories of founders of these restaurants and loves
        her position here at Healthy Food.

        Our next founder is Jenna Ward! She is from the East Coast and came 
        to the West Coast to follow her dreams to work with food. She has 
        considered herself a "foody" her whole life, but was never the best
        cook or baker. Sh, she found joy in testing out her family and friends
        new recipes. By doing so, she became and expert and would test food 
        and restaurants wherever she went. She loves her career and would not
        change it for the world!
